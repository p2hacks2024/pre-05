    "ピックアップレビュー": "Stayed at an inn near Goryokaku and guided my sister to find seafood lol\nIt took less than 30 minutes for the first item to come out, and the second item was sticky fried octopus and crispy fried cartilage.\nWhat kind of thing is it?\nIs the sashimi platter normal?\nHomemade meatballs... It's undercooked and loose gyoza seeds... The seasoning is gyoza seeds lol\nDid you try the food?\nNew players come even though the halls are not running, there are only 2 hall staff, and the operation is collapsing.The staff is not bad, it's the owner...\nI got the impression that the store left everything to one random employee and left it alone.\nI'm sorry but I won't go there again. It's crazy to have a restaurant where families can enter for free at 7pm on Saturday, the first day of the holidays.The family that came later arrived right away and was left alone for the next 30 minutes...\nWhen I left the store, I paid for the food that I ordered but didn't arrive, and my family of three paid 10,000 yen in tuition fees."

If you make a reservation for two people, you will not be able to place your order on the table unless you order while thinking about the small size of the table. Also, even though I ordered all-you-can-drink, I couldn't get any drinks at all when the restaurant got crowded. You can't even talk loudly inside the store."

    "ピックアップレビュー": "Came here for an end of year party for my office. It's a bit tucked away down a small side street.\nThe entryway is VERY SMALL and low, everyone had to hunch over to get it. Other than that the establishment is really clean and nice.\n\nThe staff were very attentive even though we were a large group (about 20 persons). We had the downstairs dining area reserved. The cooking area was off to the side but you could see the staff at work behind the short curtains. Someone was always present to take orders and other requests\n\nIt seems like it would be Japanese style seating but there is a well of sorts beneath the tables so that person's can sit regularly.\n\nWe had a 7 course meal. This party cost 7,000 yen each, it included nabe,fois gras, sashimi, a seafood mix, steamed codfish with its testicles, noodles that accompanied the nabe soup stock, rare steak slices with veggies and dessert of ice cream and fruit. Everything was great other than the codfish thing. That looked very unappealing and oily.\n\nOverall it was a lovely experience."

If you want beer, you have to upgrade to the next course.\nAlso, the all-you-can-eat menu is basically various snacks with a few salads. I guess it's a fine course if you just wanna have some snacks with friends while drinking, but not great if you want to feel like you're eating \"a real meal\".\nYou order off the tablet. It says there's an English option, but there's not, really. The tabs are in English, but all the food and drink items are in Japanese, still. If you can't read kanji, you have to go by the pictures.\nThe food itself was really good, and cooked well. The service was also really fast. The drinks arrived almost right after we ordered, and the food was also very quick."

The cost performance is good.\nAs other people have commented, when I visited, there was only one person assigned to the kitchen and one person in the hall, but the wait from ordering to serving the food was not that long...\n\nAs I was drinking, I thought, ``As expected,'' but at the same time I felt sympathy for him, thinking, ``It must be difficult.''\n\nIt is difficult to secure human resources, but if we had 1 more person + 1 person, it would have been a 4 star.\n\nHowever, the food was delicious and the alcohol was average...\n\nThank you for the meal."

You can't tell from scratch, and there are no written instructions, so you have to ask the staff each time you order.\n\nThe price of the skewers is reasonable, but the other snacks seem to be priced relatively high. Is it a large amount?\n\nI was imagining crispy grilled cheese wrapped in a so-called spring roll wrapper, but it was something I didn't expect at all.\nThe cheese itself is crunchy, like a snack, and is eaten with pizza sauce. It was new to me as a snack.\n\nThere is a wide variety of skewers on the menu, so I think you can enjoy a variety of things."

    "ピックアップレビュー": "2024/10月末　初訪問\n新しいお店の為あえて厳しい評価をさせていただきます。\nまず肉と海鮮というコンセプトに少し疑問を感じます。周りの方も多くは肉を食べていたのではないかと思うので焼肉屋でいいのかと。刺身や焼き魚もあり幅広く食べられるというようにしたいのでしょうが、どちらかに特化した方がリピートがあると思う。メニューも多過ぎるのではと感じました。\n当初他の方が言っていた煙対策はかなり改善されたのでしょうが、ダストが丸型なのに焼き台が四角く煙の取りこぼしがあるのか、他の焼肉屋に比べたらまだ煙たいと感じます。\nそして肝心の商品ですが、肉の品質は悪くないですが、とにかく量が少なく感じお得感がない。他の焼肉屋ではお腹いっぱいの値段で腹八分目でした。またご飯がやわらかくてかたまりもあり、たまたま炊き方がよくなかったのか残念ながら美味しくなかった…タレの皿が普通の皿ではなく、小さく半分高さの違う皿で足りなくなる。タレのおかわりは無料ですが、すぐ無くなってしまいます。\n注文は自身のスマホでの注文で、慣れている人には問題ないです。自身でのスマホ注文スタイルであればバイトの若い子数人と配膳ロボットへコストをかけるくらいならもう少し商品の量や値段を考えてほしい。\nレバー、いちぼ、カルビなど一皿に4枚程度の量です。ホルモンも大きいままのものもあったりで残念なとこがありました。\nビールはサントリーです。個人の好みもあると思いますがキンキンに冷えたジョッキを選べるのでここは良いと思いました。\n場所が近いのでとても期待して伺ったのですが、残念ながらこのままであれば再訪はないというのが正直な感想です。\n残念と驚きで写真を撮ることを忘れてしまいました。　他の方の口コミなどで変化や改善があればまたいつか再訪できればと思います。"

I ordered the venison, a rarity, and it was worth it. The thin sliced meat maximized the surface area, the ponzu sauce complimented the meat and oolong tea washed it all down. A better combo doesn't exist. Any venison lovers or meat fans in general should check it out (it costs about ¥1400 for the venison dish and drink)."

    "ピックアップレビュー": "Sorry no pictures. I just ate here (July 2023) and this izakaya was great. Everything was just a little better than it should have been for the price.\n\nOrdering system is via QR code—which I normally don't care for—but once I got my head around the system, it was super easy to use, and also lets you keep an eye on your running tab, so there are no surprises at the end. Lack of a detailed check can sometimes be vexing at izakayas, especially if you are a foreign tourist and worried about being taken advantage of. The website shows a detailed total of everything you've ordered.\n\nI'm able to use Japanese, but one advantage of this store's QR code system is that if you open the ordering site on a browser with built-in translation (google chrome, etc.), you can see all the items on the menu translated into whatever language you choose. So even though I could have 我慢'd in Japanese, I just let Chrome translate everything. This became more useful after a few drinks :-/\n\nHigh points: Japanese-style tuna and avocado salad (amazing), shiso and chicken gyoza (also amazing); grilled shishito peppers, tsukne (chicken meatball) and fried potatoes all above average.\n\nBGM is American hip-hop with super-obscene English lyrics, so if that could be a problem for you, please take note. (It's not for me.)\n\nStaff was super pleasant, and an all-around great experience. Recommended, if I'm back in Hakodate I shall return.\n\n(Also note that my total may be higher than average because I drank a lot. You could easily get out of here for ¥2,000–¥3,500 if you are not drinking much.)"

Although we ordered over 30 sticks + drinks, the bill only came up to around JPY 7000 for the two of us. The service crew was also friendly and attentive, going around asking if everything was okay (if we needed more cabbage or sauce etc whenever they saw that we ran low). The shop also offers english menus if needed. Do note that they require each diner to order a drink (if over 20 years of age) even if you don't intend to drink. Overall still a very good experience though."

Is it the lunch price?\nAnyway, it's a nice discount.\nAfter ordering, the food was served in about 5 minutes.\nIt looks very nice.\nThere are also a lot of vegetables.\nIt wasn't that it wasn't delicious, but it didn't make me want to eat it again.\nProbably, but is roast pork a processed product for commercial use? Isn't it made in a store? That's what I thought. (Sorry if it's wrong)\nPilaf also doesn't seem to have any special characteristics.\nThere are many other menu items such as pasta and pizza, and the parfait seems to be popular, so next time I would like to order a different menu.\nI could use smartphone payment"

They set up a little mattress for our 3 month old to sleep on while we ate. The hostess also carried our baby when she was acting fussy so that we could eat. Even though English was limited they used translation app and explained all the dishes to us. The food was pretty good and enough to fill us up. Overall the omakase experience took about 1.5 hours.

The sashimi is also fresher than at a crappy izakaya. Ajillo was delicious. It would be even more delicious if it had mushrooms in it.\nIt's a shame that the price compared to the quantity is the same as or lower than the price at the izakaya in the Goryokaku area.\nIn the Daimon area, the price and taste balance is getting better.\nThe menu isn't bad, but I'd like some nikujagaya or izakaya-style skewers. (I think it would be better if there were more menu items)\n\nThe way the rice balls were held was good, and the Saikyoyaki was delicious.\nThis is a healing shop for men who have worked hard at work."

    "ピックアップレビュー": "# Hokkaido Dadi Kitchen Food Tour\n#汉鹿 This Chimei (おきび) izakaya serves Hakodate’s special local cuisine - sika deer🦌\n#There are approximately 700,000 sika deer in Hokkaido causing serious agricultural damage\n#Hokkaido’s local cuisine is also influenced by the local aboriginal food culture.\nThe same deer has two lives! In Nara, there is no need to worry about eating deer, but in Hokkaido, wild deer are killed without mercy.\n\nThe best thing tonight was the medium-rare venison steak, and the grilled venison meatball skewers were also delicious. Some parts, such as the venison shank... were sold out, which was a pity. It has a bit of \"deer tongue\", which is not recommended in this dish, and it has a fishy smell.\n\nThe rest are just regular skewers, but the seasoning is a bit too salty. Still didn't get the squid sashimi, only grilled squid that was dried overnight. The fried chicken recommended by the store was actually very good.\nIt goes well with Sapporo Lager!\n\nAttached is the internet information -\n■エゾシカ「Hanlu」\n[The Kosan area of ​​Hakodate City has little snowfall, is affected by active volcanoes, and has high geothermal heat even in winter. It is the main breeding ground for sika deer.\n\nSika deer near Hakodate live along the Tsugaru Strait. In addition to weeds rich in salt and minerals, they also eat field crops such as carrots, potatoes, pumpkins, and edamame.\n\nDue to the aging of the population, there are fewer farmers and hunters. Wild deer are no longer a threat, and there are more abandoned farmlands to feast on. The reproduction rate is astonishing, forcing the Japanese government to encourage people to hunt and eat game, and even restaurants are offering venison meals. According to statistics, agricultural losses caused by wild animals in Japan exceed 20 billion yen every year, and wild deer and wild boars are both known as the two major pests. 〕"

I was a little nervous when I entered, but I was relieved to find that many elderly people were using the service.\nThe first time I visited, I was attracted to the eel bowl and ordered it even though it wasn't 500 yen.\nThe eel was probably heated in a hot water bath or something, which is not domestically produced, but it was odorless, soft, voluminous, and served quickly!\nI loved it so much that I immediately came back for a second time.\nI ordered the ginger grilled set meal.\nHowever, it was probably a day when many nearby students were visiting the store, so it took more than 30 minutes for the food to be served, so maybe they were in a hurry? Did I get the seasoning wrong?\nIt tasted quite bland.\nFurthermore, the person who arrived a little later than me had the same order, so I feel like the order of the food was served incorrectly. (Sorry if you came to the store earlier and just moved from a different seat)\nAfter a while, I used it for the third time without hesitation.\nWill it be crowded as soon as I enter? Does it take time? After checking, I ordered the keema curry.\nI was seated after ordering, and the food was served in less than 5 minutes.\nThe atmosphere was a little different from the keema curry I was expecting, but it was spicy and voluminous.\nWhen I entered the restaurant, I immediately noticed the keema curry on the outside menu and didn't really check the other menus, but when I left the restaurant, I saw someone eating something like a tempura bowl, so I went outside. When I looked at the menu carefully, I found Tendon.\nI'm also curious about the green onion bowl.\nAlso, I would like to use it when there are not many visitors!\nI think it's easy for women to come in alone, as it's used by both older and younger people, like the regulars."

Also, sorry for being noisy.\nFor rice, the yakitori and soup-wrapped egg were delicious and a little different from the usual. On the second day, the hot pot was really delicious. As for drinks, the beer is cold and carbonated! I don't like sake and sour, but my friends seemed to enjoy them.\nWe recommend small groups, but large groups are also possible! I think that. There is no seat fee, so if you live in the Mihara area, why not try using it for a casual drink? I think. The customer base was diverse, including individuals, couples, and parents and children! There are also fried foods and pizza, so even if you are traveling with children, I felt you could enjoy it! Next time I will bring my family!"

It's a hidden gem located in a narrow alley on the road.It's part of an old house that has been renovated.For some reason, the female clerk didn't serve tea to all the other customers without saying anything, but she didn't serve it to me, which caused discrimination. Is that so! ? I felt sick. I had a lunch of about 1 mini soba bowl, about 3 small bites of small rice, about 3 small bites of vegetable tempura, salad, and shinko, but there wasn't a lot of soba either, and overall I wasn't satisfied with the soba flour. I think they use good ones. I think it's good for girls who eat very little, but it's not enough for guys.\nIt is located on a narrow, one-way street with only three parking spaces, and is difficult to find and reach.\nI don't think I'll go again."

    "ピックアップレビュー": "I had a chance to talk about various things with the friendly and interesting master.\nAfter visiting two restaurants in Hakodate, I wanted to go to a third bar, so I wandered around the city for about 30 minutes in the cold, looking for a bar that suited me, but most of the bars were filled with young people. There were a lot of shops that felt cluttered and noisy, so I didn't feel comfortable. This store is on the second floor, and I didn't know what it was like inside, so it took a lot of courage to enter, but I really wanted to go in, so my companion and I decided to go inside and decided to try it out. I did. It was correct. The time passed quickly as I drank slowly and quietly, and talked happily with my master about various things.\nI don't have many opportunities to go to Hakodate, but I often think about this shop and the master, and wonder if he's doing well. That's what I'm thinking. I will definitely go again if I go to Hakodate. Until then, I definitely want the store to continue operating.\n\n・Since I mainly drank, I did not eat, so I did not evaluate the \"meal\" aspect."

If you can make it to the second restaurant, you'll be able to enjoy simple Italian meat dishes that allow you to appreciate the flavor of the ingredients.

Otherwise, I would have wanted to eat it for two days in a row~~ The curry is dry, a little spicy and very appetizing~ The hot cocoa is also delicious❤️\n\nI took a cake away when I left because it was triangular in shape and looked like meringue on top. I originally thought it was sweet potato flavored, but I didn’t expect it to be lemon. The appearance and taste were different from the stereotype of a lemon tart. I regretted it. I brought one and it was not enough for my husband and me🤤🤤\n\nIt's delicious and not expensive. If I come to Hakodate again, it will be a store I will definitely visit again!"

It is a mom and pop type of restaurant and I promise you, after you taste their sushis, you will never want to eat at sushi place in the US or Canada again. Food is an art. When you eat a real Unagi (eel) roll at this place, you feel as if a concert of flavor is playing in your mouth. It is an incredible food experience that I would recommend to anyone who wants to discover what a real sushi place is."

First, we tasted the lean meat without adding anything, then we poured soy sauce around the bowl and added one slice of each slice, and added wasabi to the rest.\nThe taste is truly exquisite. I have tasted domestic tuna from Shiogama and Katsuura, but the Tsugaru Strait has a rich flavor that is completely different. Oma is famous for the tuna in the Tsugaru Strait, but this is recommended as it is a short walk from Goryokaku Station, making it easier to visit both within and outside of Hokkaido.\nIt's a bit pricey, but the tuna was worth it."

I thought it would be stewed, so I chose stewed.\nI thought it would be cream-stewed young chicken and mountain burdock, but when I actually looked at the menu, I thought it was stewed beef.\nAt a loss, I decided to order the young chicken, which I had decided on before coming to the store.\nThe meal begins with the appetizer and is served one plate at a time when the meal is finished.\nI'm embarrassed to say that I don't know much about etiquette, so I ended up doing it my own way.\nThe first appetizer that was served was a potage of Tokachi mushroom terrine and butterbur sprouts.\nFor potage, please hold the bowl in your hands and enjoy the aroma.\nI don't like the bitterness that follows the taste of butterbur, but although there was a slight bitterness, it didn't feel like it followed me, so it was easy to drink and delicious.\nI'm a big eater, so if I wanted to be a little more filling, I thought a pasta lunch would be better.\nI'm also interested in the quiche, they have a wide variety of pasta menus, and the cakes all looked so delicious that I couldn't decide, so I'd like to visit again."

I like that they allow us to opt for half rice for their sushi to allow us to try more.

I have to say that everything I ordered was great. My only down point was that the curry wasn't as spicy as I'd have liked it to be but I'm guessing that is in tandem with the Japanese pallet of not usually liking spicy foods.\nThe decor was nice but the restaurant is  small so even though they did groups don't bring a large group.

It was straight out of the 1980’s, all a mess of bar seating tables, unused fire pit, stacked chairs, baby chairs and boxes, and a second floor that all but obliterated the promise of soaring ceilings that we had imagined from the outside.\n\nThe beer was not to our liking (but that’s just personal taste).  What was not okay was the price. The tastings (for less that 500ml of beer) was ¥1,760. That in a town where a half litre of beer will cost you ¥500.

It's a large steak with good taste and great value for money, and the 4 types of sauces will keep you satisfied."

The service, food and atmosphere are top notch. It is possibly the best sushi I have ever have had, and I come from LA which has a lot of very good sushi restaurants. Now living in Japan, we’re planning to go back to savor and enjoy dining there again."

There are not many tables but turn over rate is quite fast. Seafood is very fresh. I love there are many side dishes. The price is cheaper than  restaurant in sapporo. It’s worth it. The staffs are very kind and friendly. I went to this restaurant two day in a row during staying in Hakodate."

Hakodate, take the branch towards Cape Tatemachi, and the entrance is immediately to the left after passing the brown nursing home. There is a fee for parking, but if you enter the building and use the machine at the reception desk on the right, you can park for free for up to 2 hours. The store is located on the right side as you enter, and the menu consists of noodles such as ramen, yakisoba, and spaghetti, and rice dishes such as omelet rice and fried rice, and there are no set meals. On this day, I ordered special ramen (miso). The pleasantly sweet soup had a tangy spiciness that went well with the medium-thick curly noodles and was delicious with plenty of toppings. The Ankake Yakisoba and other menu items looked delicious, so I would like to visit again."

The queue might be long (depending on the outlet you visit) but service is relatively fast.\n\nOnce you order, you find a table and inform them your table number. We tried the chinese chicken burger which tasted similar to deep fried 5 spice chicken. The tonkatsu burger was quite meaty as well.\n\nPersonally, I didn’t enjoy the fries that were lathered with the sauce as it makes the fries soggy. Overall, the burgers were average tasting and more of a try for novelty sake."

Nevertheless, our objective was to be able to compare the beef type in Japan. As this is our 3rd week in Japan and after trying out kobe (in kyoto) and hida (in takaysms) beef from different restaurants we decided to try here because we wanted to compare taste of hida and kobe beef. So we ordered A5 Hida center cut ribs, A5 kobe chuck ribs, A5 Japanese black beef fillet cube and beef tongue. When the dish came, we were utterly disappointed as the marbling was missing. We thought maybe after BBQ it will be ok. To our disappointment, it doest meet the mark. It is still edible but no where compare to the ones we ate in kyoto or takayama. Honestly, we felt rip off.\nAs we paid, we were shown kind gesture with popsicles hence the 2 star for food.\nOverall, I think its a 3 star. Food felt rip off but service and atmosphere is excellent."

    "ピックアップレビュー": "Tabiji is a seafood don restaurant renowned for its fresh, high-quality offerings. I visited to try the live squid over rice, and it was an unforgettable experience. The seafood is incredibly fresh, with the live squid still moving when it’s served. The tentacles continue to move as you eat, gently interacting with each other and releasing sweet, succulent juices. It’s a unique and intense culinary experience.\n\nA word of advice: be prepared to remove your shoes, as the seating here is traditional tatami style, where diners sit on mats.\n\nSome cultures believe that eating live seafood, like squid, enhances the freshness and flavor, providing a more vibrant taste. The staff at Tabiji went out of their way to communicate with English-speaking customers like me, creating a warm and comfortable dining atmosphere. Their efforts truly made the experience even more enjoyable."
